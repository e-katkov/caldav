# Changelog

All notable to this project starting from v1.2 will be documented in this file.

Changelogs prior to v1.2 has been removed, but are available in the
v1.2-release.  The project started with a GNU ChangeLog, but it was
useless and horrible to maintain.  Then I made up my own kind of
changelogs for a while, until someone pointed me towards
https://keepachangelog.com.  The format of this file is more or less
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

This project should more or less adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
